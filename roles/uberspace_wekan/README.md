# Uberspace WeKan setup Ansible role

This **stub** of an [Ansible role](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_reuse_roles.html) is targeted to setup a [WeKan](https://wekan.github.io/) server at the German exceptional hoster [Uberspace](https://uberspace.de/). It is not working yet. It is not officially maintained by the company. I am only one of their customers.
